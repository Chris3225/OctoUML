PenguinUML is a **UML diagram creation tool**, designed with the intention of combining formal UML notations with informal notations, specifically drawings. The user can create diagram elements either by using the formal tools or by transforming drawings to UML. 


The development of this software started of as a master's thesis. The purpose of the application is to support software designers through all phases of design. From the idea-and brainstorming-phase to the documentation-phase.

PenguinUML currently only supports class diagrams. The software is designed to be interacted with using a large touch screen, it is currently being tested using a [SMART Board 800](https://education.smarttech.com/sv-se/products/smart-board-800).
The software is built using the MVC architecture in Java, utilizing JavaFX graphics library.

The library used for recognizing drawings is [Paleo Sketch](http://srl-mechanix.appspot.com/).
